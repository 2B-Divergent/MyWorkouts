My Workouts
------------

A simple exercise tracker that stores data in HealthKit rather than in the Cloud, as I could not find an existing app out there that didn't need me to sign up, and Apple only support workout tracking on the Watch, and I can't wear a watch.

Not very featureful, but something I use (close to) daily.
